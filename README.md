## Website Progress Tracker

This project is a simple web app to help you track your reading or learning progress on websites that provide content in chapters or lessons. It allows you to fetch a list of chapters from a given URL, store your progress locally, and resume later.

### Features

- Fetch chapters automatically from a given URL and CSS selector.
- Manual list option if the site does not allow automated fetching.
- Progress tracking with checkboxes.
- Local storage to save progress across sessions.
- Resume dashboard to manage multiple sites.
- Netlify Functions to handle CORS for safe cross-origin requests.
